                                </h2>
                                <p>At the end of each school term, our school organizes a field trip.
                                    You can document your field trip experiences by taking photos such as the scenery, and photos with your friends. For example, we went to the Bird Paradise,
                                    the new bird park in Singapore, and I featured some photos of my memorable experiences during the trip in my scrapbook. On the sides of the page, I wrote my 
                                    expectations and experiences during the field trip, as well as how grateful I am to be able to join and learn about new animals that I have never seen before. I find 
                                    scrapbooking an enjoyable activity because it helps me cultivate my creativity and writing skills.  

                                    I printed the photos on a sticker paper so I do not need to use glue to paste the photos. Previously, I used glue to paste the photos in the scrapbook but it left a huge mark, leaving
                                    it crumpled with wet stains on the next page. I am using a scrapbook with quite thin paper, so it was not a very pleasant experience.

                                    <p>Whenever you and your friends hang out, you can use it as an opportunity to place it into your scrapbook. This helps capture memories with your friends.
                                        For example, I have documented my hangout with my friend when we went to Haji Lane. Afterwards, I hanged out with my parents. I 
                                        placed my favourite pictures of the day, and some decorations around. This page is plastered with glue and normal printing paper. You can 
                                        choose to see which one you like the most!

                                        trip. This may be hard if you love to take a ton of photos every time you are outdoors, but you can choose photos that made your travel more meaningful,
                                        fun, and engaging. You can also place your airplane tickets into the scrapbook to remember where you were seated. I like to do this because I 
                                        seldom travel.
